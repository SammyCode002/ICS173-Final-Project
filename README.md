# ICS 173: Data Science Final Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains my final project for the ICS 173: Introduction to Data Science course. The project involves data visualization and analysis of a dataset focused on tree characteristics.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project relates to tree measurements and characteristics. It includes various columns such as species, light intensity, soil type, and other ecological measurements. The dataset is instrumental in understanding tree diversity and ecological patterns.

## Files in the Repository

- `ICS173FinalProject.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization code.
- `Cleaned_Tree_Dataset.csv`: The dataset file used for the analysis.

## Analysis and Visualizations

The project includes a visualization (bar chart) that explores the distribution of different tree species within the dataset. This analysis is critical in understanding species diversity and prevalence.

## How to Run the Notebook

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Then, you can run the Jupyter Notebook using:
jupyter notebook ICS173FinalProject.ipynb

## Findings

The analysis provides insights into the most common tree species in the dataset, indicating trends in species distribution. This can be a starting point for further ecological or environmental studies.

## Future Work

Future work could involve a more detailed analysis of the relationship between tree species and environmental factors, such as light intensity and soil type. Advanced statistical methods could also be applied to predict ecological trends.
